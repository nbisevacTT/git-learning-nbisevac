**Brief Description:**
The tutorials covered the entire lifecycle of a Git project, from initial configuration and basic commands (`add`, `commit`, `status`) to more complex workflows involving branching, remote synchronization, and the difference between resetting and reverting changes.

## 2. Practical Demonstration
I have applied the learned concepts in a live GitHub repository to demonstrate proficiency in version control management.

* **Repository Name:** `git-learning-nbisevac`
* **Repository Path:** [https://github.com/nbisevacTT/git-learning-nbisevac](https://github.com/nbisevacTT/git-learning-nbisevac)

### Workflow Steps Performed:
1. **Repository Setup:** Initialized the repository and added a `README.md` with a project description.
2. **Branching:** Created two branches: `feature-content` and `cheat-sheet-addition`.
3. **Commits:** Performed multiple commits on different branches to build a clear project history.
4. **Merge Conflict Resolution:** - Intentionally modified the same line in `README.md` on both branches.
   - Successfully resolved the resulting merge conflict manually.
   - Finalized the merge with a conflict-resolution commit.

## 3. Quick Reference Sheet
I have compiled a personal cheat sheet with essential Git commands, which is included as a separate document in this repository.

* **File:** `CHEAT-SHEET.md`

### Essential Commands Included:
* **Basic:** `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git log`.
* **Intermediate:** `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`.
* **Remote:** `git push`, `git pull`, `git clone`.
* **Undoing:** `git revert`, `git reset`.
